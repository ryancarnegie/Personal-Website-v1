          <div class="word-wrapper">

            <h3 class="h3-facts">The Fact</h3>
            <p>My story is different. I am taking COMP 2132 because I voluntarily chose to enter PTS after starting in
              the
              fulltime CST program. I took the first two terms of CST at the Burnaby campus, in person, and realized I
              wanted to learn the material at a more manageable pace. I completed and passed all of term 1
              courses. Term 1 felt like a good introduction to the material, and term 2 contined that trend, but this is
              where I, and many others, fall off the rails. I had to take a step back and re-evaluate my ability to
              learn
              7 courses at once.
            </p>
            <h3>The Solution</h3>
            <p>I ended up in a random phone call with Kevin Cudihee, the CST program head. I had phoned the
              BCIT
              front desk reception. They asked if I wanted to speak to anyone in particular, I said someone at
              PTS for information. She said I needed to ask for a name in the department, I said the "only name
              I
              am familiar with was Kevin from a consultation alongside Donna Turner during the first term of fulltime
              CST."" Reception handed me right to Kevin's personal number, and I knew it was his personal number when he
              answered with a "hello".
              I had a moment of panic, quickly told him who I am, what my plan is, and how I want to get there. This
              phone call mistakenly turned into a 40 minute conversation, but He
              responded rapidly and assured me my education goals would be met. </p><br>
            <p>The conversation single-handedly set a course for a new path, one that I should had started two terms
              earlier. It was apparent to me education was not about a race to the finish line, but a steady,
              consistent,
              journey for knowledge, that must be developed and harnassed into a solid foundation that lasts a lifetime.
              That foundation began the day I registered for PTS.</p>
            <p>I'm still technically in the fulltime program doing a side-plan for Rahul, but I may stay part time. I
              am starting to prefer it. I'll make the decision whether to return to fulltime next term when my PTS part
              is complete.</p>

        <p>With JavaScript I could make these images clickable and smoothly expandable! Soon I will learn such tricks.
          But at
          least I can do box-shadow in CSS without JavaScript!</p>
        <p>I decided to build this website from scratch to gain a
          better
          understanding of CSS and HTML technology. I will be implementing some of my programs to github, and make my
          projects and website
          easily accessible to the audience, as well as potential employers. Front end was not my strongest, however, it
          has become a personal favorite through the art of practice and diligence. These websites have allowed me to
          experiment outside my comfort zone, and get ready for the job world in tech.</p>
